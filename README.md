# Get Sentry

## Background

This bash script should give quick setup of Sentry services based on the guide of the official GetSentry docker hub's [page](https://hub.docker.com/_/sentry/). There should be better way to ochestrate this, example docker-compose perhaps, but make sure to handle initial setup deligently `sentry upgrade`

## Run

`$ docker run_docker_sentry.sh`
